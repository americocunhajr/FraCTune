Manual, for older MATLAB versions
The installation currently comprises the following steps:

Decompress the zipped folder into a directory of your choice, e.g. *C:\fomcon*
Setup the directory in your MATLAB path. In the MATLAB, go to File > Set Path... and click on Add with Subfolders.... Now, select the directory that contains the fomcon folder.
Save the path for future MATLAB sessions (usually administrator priveleges are necessary). This completes the installation.
Checking if installation succeeded
In MATLAB, type fomcon. If you can see a graphical user interface, the toolbox has been successfully installed.
