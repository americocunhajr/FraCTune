## Fractional Control Tuner via Cross-Entropy Method

**FraCTune: Fractional Control Tuner via Cross-Entropy Method** is a Matlab package that implements a framework for tuning fractional-order controllers. The package leverages the Cross-Entropy (CE) method for global search optimization and employs an augmented Lagrangian formulation to handle equality and inequality constraints. With some straightforward adaptations, the FracTune strategy can also be applied to other types of modern controllers.

**FraCTune** uses as optimization tool the package **CEopt - Cross-Entropy Optimizer**, which can be downloaded at <a href="https://ceopt.org" target="_blank">https://ceopt.org</a>.

### Overview
**FraCTune** was developed to tune fractional-order controllers for dynamical systems by solving nonconvex optimization problems via the cross-entropy method. The underlying results are reported in the following publication:

### Features
- Implements Cross-Entropy method for fractional-control tuning
- Handles equality and inequality constraints using augmented Lagrangian method
- Transparent "gray-box" optimizer with intuitive control parameters
- Robust and scalable for moderately sized complex problems
- Demonstrated applicability through select case studies

### Usage
To get started with **FraCTune**, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/americocunhajr/FraCTune.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the code directory:
   ```bash
   cd FraCTune/FraCTune-1.0
   ```
3. Navigate to the desired case directory:
   ```bash
   cd FraCTune/FraCTune-1.0/CaseX-XXX
   ```
4. To tune a fractional controller, execute the main file corresponding to your case:
   ```bash
   MainCEoptCaseX_XXXX
   ```
