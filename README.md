## Fractional Control Tunner via Cross-entropy

**FracTune: Fractional Control Tunner via Cross-entropy
** is a Matlab package that implements a framework for tuning fractional-order controllers.The package leverages the Cross-Entropy (CE) method for global search optimization and employs an augmented Lagrangian formulation to handle equality and inequality constraints. With some straightforward adaptations, the FracTune strategy can also be applied to other types of modern controllers.

**FracTune** uses as optimization tool the package **CEopt - Cross-Entropy Optimizer**, which can be downloaded at <a href="https://ceopt.org" target="_blank">https://ceopt.org</a>.

### Usage
To get started with **CROSS-OPT**, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/americocunhajr/CROSS-OPT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the code directory:
   ```bash
   cd CROSS-OPT/CROSS-OPT-1.0
   ```
3. To optimize a structure, execute the main file corresponding to your case:
   ```bash
   Main_TrussNbars_ObjFuncType_ConstraintType_Solver
   ```
